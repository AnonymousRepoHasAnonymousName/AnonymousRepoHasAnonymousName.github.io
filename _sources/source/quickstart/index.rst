.. note::

    We recommend system requirements with at least 32GB RAM and 16GB VRAM for UrbanVerse.
    For workflows with rendering enabled, additional VRAM may be required.
    For the full list of system requirements for Isaac Sim, please refer to the
    `Isaac Sim system requirements <https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/latest/installation/requirements.html#system-requirements>`_.

UrbanVerse is built on top of the Isaac ecosystem. Therefore, it is required to first install Isaac Sim
before using UrbanVerse. We highly recommend installing Isaac Sim and our project 
through binary download/source file to use the latest features and improvements.

For users getting started with UrbanVerse, we recommend installing UrbanVerse by cloning the repo.
