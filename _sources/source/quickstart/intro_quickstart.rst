Introduction to Quickstart Guide
=============================

URBAN-SIM is built on top of the Isaac ecosystem. Therefore, it is required to first install Isaac Sim
before using URBAN-SIM. We highly recommend installing Isaac Sim and our project 
through binary download/source file to use the latest features and improvements.

For users getting started with URBAN-SIM, we recommend installing URBAN-SIM by cloning the repo.
