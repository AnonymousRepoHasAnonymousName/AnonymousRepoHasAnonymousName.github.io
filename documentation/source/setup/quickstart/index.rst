Getting Started with UrbanVerse
===============================


.. note::

    We recommend system requirements with at least 32GB RAM and 16GB VRAM for URBAN-SIM.
    For workflows with rendering enabled, additional VRAM may be required.
    For the full list of system requirements for Isaac Sim, please refer to the
    `Isaac Sim system requirements <https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/latest/installation/requirements.html#system-requirements>`_.

URBAN-SIM is built on top of the Isaac ecosystem. Therefore, it is required to first install Isaac Sim
before using URBAN-SIM. We highly recommend installing Isaac Sim and our project 
through binary download/source file to use the latest features and improvements.

For users getting started with URBAN-SIM, we recommend installing URBAN-SIM by cloning the repo.
