    "description_long": "This electric car features a sharply angular, geometric design with a matte dark gray exterior, reminiscent of the Tesla Cybertruck. The body is constructed from flat, faceted panels with minimal curvature, giving it a futuristic, armored appearance. The windows are large, tinted, and trapezoidal, seamlessly integrated into the bodywork, while the wheels are covered with matching dark hubcaps. The front end is characterized by a wide, flat hood and slim headlights, while the rear has a continuous red light bar and a sloped tailgate. The vehicle sits relatively high off the ground, suggesting off-road capability, and the overall silhouette is wedge-shaped. No visible branding, license plate, or charging port is apparent, but the design cues strongly suggest a modern electric pickup.",
